# Rust Library Compatibility and Build Process for Apple Platforms

## Overview
This document outlines the process for building a Rust library compatible with various Apple platforms, including iOS, iOS Simulator, macOS, and Mac Catalyst. It is designed to assist developers working on Apple Silicon (M1) and Intel-based Macs.

## Rust Target Compatibility for Apple Silicon (M1) Macs

### Current Status
As of [current date], when using Rust on Apple Silicon (M1) Macs, there are limitations regarding the availability of pre-compiled standard libraries (`rust-std`) for certain targets. This affects the ability to build Rust code for specific Apple platforms, particularly for certain iOS Simulator and Mac Catalyst targets.

### Affected Targets
The following targets are not supported with pre-compiled `rust-std` components in the nightly toolchain `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin`:

- `x86_64-apple-ios-sim`: For iOS Simulator on Intel-based Macs.
- `x86_64-apple-ios-macabi`: For Mac Catalyst on Intel-based Macs.
- `aarch64-apple-ios-macabi`: For Mac Catalyst on Apple Silicon Macs.

### Alternative Approach
For unsupported platforms, compile the standard library from source using the `-Z build-std` flag with `cargo build`:

```
cargo build --target <your-target> -Z build-std
```

### Recommendation
Building the standard library from source for these targets requires careful consideration due to the complexity. Stay updated with the Rust toolchain for future support of these targets.

### Note on Simulator and Catalyst Targets
- `aarch64-apple-ios` is suitable for iOS Simulator development on M1 Macs.
- Focus on supported architectures for Mac Catalyst and monitor updates for `macabi` target support.

## Building Static Libraries for All Platforms

### Standard Targets
Build for standard targets using regular or nightly toolchains:

```
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-ios       # iOS devices (ARM64)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-ios        # iOS Simulator (Intel)
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-ios-sim   # iOS Simulator (ARM64, M1)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin     # macOS (Intel)
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin    # macOS (ARM64, M1)
```

### Mac Catalyst Targets
For Mac Catalyst (macabi) targets, build using the nightly toolchain:

```
cargo +nightly build --release -Z build-std --target x86_64-apple-ios-macabi
cargo +nightly build --release -Z build-std --target aarch64-apple-ios-macabi
```

### Creating a Universal (Fat) Library
Use lipo to create a fat library combining architectures into a single binary:

```
lipo -create -output libhelloios.a target/*/release/libhelloios.a
```

### Verification
Verify the contents of your universal library:

```
lipo -info libhelloios.a
```
